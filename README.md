# 🌐 LLM Agent [Gleam AI](https://tds-bonus-project-llm-agent.vercel.app/) — Browser-Based Multi-Tool Reasoning

This project is a **proof-of-concept (POC)** for building a **browser-based LLM agent** that can combine **natural language reasoning** with **external tools** like search engines, pipelined APIs, and even **live JavaScript execution**.  

Modern LLM agents aren’t limited to text — they dynamically integrate multiple tools and loop until tasks are solved. This app demonstrates that idea with a **minimal, hackable UI + JavaScript agent core**.

## 🚀 Features

✅ **Multi-Provider Model Picker**  
- Choose between **AI Pipe Proxy API** (default), OpenAI GPT, Gemini, Claude, and others.  
- Dynamic dropdown for switching providers & models.  

✅ **Reasoning Loop Agent**  
- Takes user input, queries the LLM, and loops with tool calls until the task is done.  
- Uses **OpenAI-style tool/function calls** for tool invocation.  

✅ **Supported Tools**  
- 🔎 **Google Search Snippets** – Fetch relevant web info.  
- 🔗 **AI Pipe Proxy API** – Flexible AI workflows & pipelines.  
- ⚡ **JavaScript Sandbox** – Execute JS code securely inside the browser.  

✅ **Robust UI/UX**  
- Bootstrap-based clean design.  
- Streaming-style chat window with file upload.  
- Graceful error handling via **bootstrap alerts**.  
- Performance monitor & tool action logging for debugging.

## 📋 Project Overview

### Goal
Build a minimal JavaScript-based agent that can:  
1. Accept user input in the browser.  
2. Query an LLM for reasoning.  
3. Dynamically trigger **tool calls** (search, AI workflows, code execution).  
4. Loop until the LLM decides no more tools are needed.

### Agent Logic (Conceptual)



### JavaScript Implementation
This POC reimplements the above loop in **browser JavaScript**, connected to provider APIs.
